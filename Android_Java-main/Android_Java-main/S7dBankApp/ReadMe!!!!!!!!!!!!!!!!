Technologies Used:
-Android SDK: For building the Android application.
-Java: The programming language used for the app's development.
-Android UI Components: EditText, TextView, and Toast are used for user input and displaying results.
-Compound Interest Calculation: Implemented using the formula 
A= P X (1+(r/100))^t
Lessons Learned:
