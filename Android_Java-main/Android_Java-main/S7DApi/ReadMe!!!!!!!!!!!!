This Android app demonstrates how to integrate various APIs using Android Java. It includes three different activities that showcase API interactions, asynchronous processing, and data handling.

Activities:
-MainActivity: Fetches movie details from the OMDB API and displays information such as plot, actors, ratings, and poster images.
-MainActivity2: Translates text using the MyMemory Translation API from English to Arabic.
-MainActivity3: Uses multithreading to execute tasks asynchronously and display results in the UI.
-MealActivity: Retrieves and displays meal data from a JSON API using Gson for JSON parsing.

What I Learned:
-API Integration: How to use Volley for making HTTP requests to APIs and handling JSON responses.
-JSON Parsing: Utilizing Gson for parsing JSON data into Java objects and handling data efficiently.
-Asynchronous Processing: Implementing multithreading with ExecutorService for background task execution and managing results.
-UI Updates: Handling UI updates from background threads using runOnUiThread() and ExecutorService.

Technologies and Libraries Used:
-Volley: A library for managing network requests and responses. It simplifies making HTTP requests and handling JSON data.
-Gson: A library for converting JSON into Java objects and vice versa. It is used for parsing the JSON response from the meal API.
-Picasso: A library for loading and caching images from URLs into ImageView.
-ExecutorService: For managing asynchronous tasks and background processing.

Key Features:
-Movie Details: Fetch and display movie details such as plot, actors, and ratings from the OMDB API.
-Text Translation: Translate English text to Arabic using the MyMemory Translation API.
-Meal Information: Retrieve and display meal information from a JSON API, including item name, category, description, price, and image.
