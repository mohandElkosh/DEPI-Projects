This repository contains two Android applications that demonstrate the use of location-based services and address geocoding in Android. The first app retrieves and displays the current geographical location of the user,
while the second app calculates the distance between two addresses. Both applications utilize the AirLocation library and the Geocoder class.

Key Features:
-Location Retrieval: Uses the AirLocation library to request and obtain the device's current location.
-Address Geocoding: Utilizes the Geocoder class to convert latitude and longitude into a readable address.
-Error Handling: Displays error messages in case of failure to obtain the location or address.

Libraries Used:
-AirLocation: Simplifies location retrieval.
-Geocoder: Converts location coordinates into a human-readable address.

Code Summary:
AirLocation is initialized and started when the user clicks a button.
On successful location retrieval, latitude and longitude are displayed.
Address is fetched using Geocoder and displayed alongside the location.
App 2: Address Distance Calculator
Purpose: This app calculates the distance between two user-provided addresses and displays the result.

Key Features:
-Address Geocoding: Converts user-input addresses into latitude and longitude using Geocoder.
-Distance Calculation: Calculates the distance between two geographical locations.
-Error Handling: Provides user feedback if the addresses cannot be found.

Libraries Used:
-Geocoder: Used for converting addresses into coordinates and calculating distances.

Code Summary:
Geocoder is used to fetch latitude and longitude for both addresses.
The distance between the two locations is calculated using Location.distanceTo().
The calculated distance is displayed to the user.

What I Learned:
-Using AirLocation Library: Gained experience with AirLocation for simplified location retrieval.
-Geocoding Addresses: Learned how to use Geocoder to convert addresses to coordinates and vice versa.
-Distance Calculation: Implemented distance calculation between two geographical points using Location.distanceTo().
-Handling Permissions and Errors: Managed location permissions and handled potential errors effectively.
-Libraries and Tools
-AirLocation: A library for simplified location retrieval in Android.
-Geocoder: An Android class for converting addresses into geographical coordinates and calculating distances.
-Android Location API: Utilized for location-based functionalities.
